# Assignment 2 - Sean Kirk

_**Visualization 1**_
While I don't find the overall look and feel of this visualization very captivating, I do appreciate some of the choices with respect to chart type.  For the _Monthly Performance_ graphs, it seemed appropriate to use a line graph to show the corresponding trends overtime.  Additionally, from what I can tell, it appears that this visualization tool has some dynamic element to it which allows the user to select different metrics, products and regions to change what data is being presented in some of the charts.  I find this dynamic element interesting and probably engaging for a user to interact with.

The pie charts in the bottom right make comparisons between categories particularly difficult, for example, in the Product Revenue Distribution pie, it’s hard to tell what the values and differences are between some of the slices (e.g. purple v. blue).  Perhaps there are some hover overs that include this information but it is not instantly apparent.  The _Quarterly Performance to Goal_ bar charts have a lot of wasted space between the bars and the colors are a bit distracting.  I'm wondering if it might be a better use of space to combine some of these bar charts if possible.  Additionally, to save some space, it might be better to use some drop downs for the different filters/metrics so there is more space for the actual charts and data.

_**Visualization 2**_
•	The y-axis labels are extremely unclear on most of the line charts.  
•	The labels also take up a significant amount of space relative to the actual charts themselves.  Overall the amount of space in the visualization that is used to display data vs. negative space is totally skewed in the wrong direction.
•	The 3d pie charts are a big no-no per out lectures.  Not only are pie charts hard to digest, adding the 3D and skewed perspective elements into the mix makes this even more difficult for the viewer. 
•	All of the legends are not very descriptive - they all indicate "Row #" which I have no idea what that means. 
•	It looks like some of the line graphs share the same elements within the their legends, if this is always true - it might be useful, in addition to make those labels more understandable, to combine the legends for concurrent graphs to save space and increase the size of the charts.
•	While we lack specific context for this visualization, the titles of these graphs seems to be succinctly and relatively clear.
•	What I believe are filters on the left-hand side, if they are mutually exclusive options, might be better presented as a drop down/combo box to free up space for displaying more data.


_**Visualization 3**_
•	I thought this was a pretty interesting visualization.  It took a little bit of time to completely understand what was being conveyed but once I did I found that I could make comparisons between the team and the platform average.  
•	It actually took me a moment to completely realize that I was looking at a stacked bars graph which I think is interesting.  The overall design incorporating the football theme into it was an interesting approach however, it does violate some of the elements that we discussed in the lectures.  There is almost an equal amount of ink used thematically as there is for the actual data being represented.  So the stylization/theme-ing might be a bit heavy handed here.  Perhaps decreasing the saturation/visibility of the thematic elements to the point where they almost non-visible might be helpful
•	If the context of this visualization requires this thematic approach to be utilized - it might be worthwhile to also include a stripped down version of the visualization without those elements elsewhere, so users could toggle/flip back and forth if they find those elements distraction
•	The use of color saturation to differentiate the different slices of the bar is nicely done.  However, it may just be because this is a photo but having a very thin border around the slices might be helpful in differentiating some of the slices, particularly the two darkest slices for the Platform Average
•	Since the end zones areas are rectangular and colored consistently with the values in the legend, I almost thought they had meaning in the context of the visualization rather than just being essentially labels.  I found them a bit distracting.
