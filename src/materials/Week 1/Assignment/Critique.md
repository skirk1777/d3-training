_**Visualization 1**_
I thought this was a pretty effective visualization.  Having the grouped bar chart along with pretty distinct colors allows the viewer to quickly view all the metrics as well as do some comparisons across the different Strategies.  

I am a bit confused about the line component to this visualization - looking up the color of the line in the legend seems to suggest that it is the total - however it is not completely clear to me at first glance what total actually corresponds to - especially with two y-axis labels (amount and product value).  I found the legend a bit different from what I'm familiar with seeing for this type of chart both in layout and postion.  I thought perhaps having the legend spanning vertically/stacked instead of horizontally and not directly below the title would be a potential improvement to the flow of the graphic.

_**Visualization 2**_
Since there is a lot going on here, it seems a bit overwhelming at first glance.  If this an interactive visualization one potential way to simplify the design visually, while still offering the same level of detail, would be to have some of the numeric values appear in hover-overs instead of statically on the chart - specfically maybe the %'s that float to the right of the bar chart segments.  There is no title to this chart so its unclear to me what is being presented.  The y-axis does not have a label which alost makes this unclear.  

_**Visualization 3**_
Although I have a few suggestions for potential improvements to this visualization, although a little corny, I thought that incorporating a color theme and some graphics to support the "theme" of the data was an interesting idea, even if it wasn't executed the best. The graphics do add a lot of noise to the overall visualization.

The stacked bar chart on the top, _Adult Halloween Patricipation Rate_, I thought was effective and works well with binary or a small nunber of possible categories.  Including the actual % values within the bars allows the user to glance at a high level to get a very quick reading of the participation rate but also allows them to drill down and get the actual %'s.

I also thought that the _Spending on Constumes_ bar chart at the bottom of the images was simple but effective.  However, it may have been helpful to also include the relative percentages for each category to allow the user to more easily do a comparison between those categories.  Also, its not clear if the colors have meaning or they are just their to contribute to the overall theme of the graphic.

The _Average Spending on Halloween_ and _Average Spending per Person on Item_ utilizes area to to convey the values  which makes it difficult to interpret.  You can make really relative comparisons between years when there is a huge differenc in size like 2009 vs 2012 but it would be
