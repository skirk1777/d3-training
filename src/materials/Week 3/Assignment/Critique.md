# Assignment 3 
### Part 4 - Critique
I found this visualization to be a little tough to read in some spots.  The line chart conflicts with the bar chart values, specifically in February.  
The bar chart values might work better as a hover-over/tool tip if the intention is to make this interactive.
The use of '2014' on the x-axis is a bit redundant.  The year could be conveyed one time in the title of the visualization or as a larger x-axis label.
The months of the years could be translated to their corresponding ordinal numbers to simplify the axis and save some space.
The space between the bars is just as big as the bars which causes a little bit of visual conflict, I suggest increasing the size of the bars or decreasing the gap between them.
This might better as two seperate visualizations that appear side by side.
The 'OrderID' reference in the legend seems a bit bizzare to me - I would expect this to be order count or somethign similar.
The repeating "k" for the Amount of sales could be removed and incorproated into the right y-axis label.
