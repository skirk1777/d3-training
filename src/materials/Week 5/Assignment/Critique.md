### Part 3
I thought this was a pretty interesting infographic and the use of the blood red color and inverted bar graphic to mimick blood dripping is an interesting approach.  To me, this inforgraphic appears to be something that you would find a newspaper or magazine and the "edginess" in its appraoch to grab the readers attention is intentional.  While I think this infographic is sucessful in some respect, mainly in grabbing people's attention; there are areas which may cause confusion and be unclear to viewers.  

The inverted Monthly Fatalities bar graph challenges our perception of the standard bar graph by turning it on its head - which could be confusing to some viewers.  I could see someone misinterpresting the negative space (the areas white) at a quick glance as what is being presented (the data).
The 'Invasion to March, 19, 2008' label might be better position closer to the x-axis origin where we see the year labels and month tick marks.
I thought that, the 'Coalition fatalities by area' map could have benefited froms some additional contrast in the tones used to weight the fatalities by area/region.  On my monitor, the gray tones bleed together.
For this same map, I thought that the buckets used to classifed the data could be a little misleading; with the first bucket/color being 0-99 and the second 100-499. 
'The biggest killers' graph makes comparisons between the different methods very hard because of the use of area as the weighting mechanism.  Additionally, the overlapping categories of 'Executions' and 'Small arms gunfire' makes comparison even more unlikely.
